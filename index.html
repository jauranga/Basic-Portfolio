	<p id="full">I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. - Isaac Newton

	The Isaac Newton (1642 - 1727) quote above, from Memoirs of the Life, Writing, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton (1885) by Sir David Brewster speaks to the depth of what we have left to discover. This world is grand and there lies an ocean of undiscovered findings that are waiting for eager and curious minds.
